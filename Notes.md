## Ideas for next iterations
0. Add new attribute (optional image) to work with Transformables
1. Sorting (by due date, by category, etc.)
2. Do migrations. Priority from 0 (low) 1(med) 2(high) to its own entity with priority and color associated.
3. Do an importer from a json in background
4. Create a little framework for the app. (maybe extracting coredata? I would like to start as simple as possible so maybe...)
5. Hability to mark items as done
6. Any usecase for use DispatchSemaphore


## Done
